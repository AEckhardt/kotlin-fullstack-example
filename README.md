# Kotlin Full Stack Example

This is an extension of the Kotlin Hands-On Lab project [Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/).

I styled the frontend using kotlin-styled.
I extended the api to include a put function and added an editing component in the frontend. 
The backend uses kotlin-exposed to connect to a postgresql database (instead of MongoDB as proposed in the tutorial).
